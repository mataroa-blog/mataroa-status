Our server provider, Hetzner, is doing some maintenance work and there might
be some increased latency:

> Maintenance at backbone connection between Frankfurt - Falkenstein

> In the above mentioned period, maintenance will be performed at the
> backbone connection between Frankfurt and Falkenstein. This may lead to brief
> latency issues. We apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you for your
> understanding.
