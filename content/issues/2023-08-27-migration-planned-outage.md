We migrated to new servers! Hooray!

We had to take the service down to dump the database and then restore in the
new server.

All went well except for an issue with custom domains which was resolved within
a few minutes!

Now more robust than ever. However, it is a new server and slightly different
setup and as the Fundamental Theorem of Systemantics says:

> New systems mean new problems

So: letâ€™s see what happens.
